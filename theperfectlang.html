            <h1>The perfect language</h1>
            <p>
                I secretly play with the idea of using retirement years to build the ultimate Functional Programming language. The one to rule them all and monadically bind them. Interpreted and compiled, with no GC and zero cost abstractions. It will have the performance of C, the power and purity of Haskell combined with the beautiful simplicity of Lisp. The magnificence of the tooling and eco system will rival that of the language itself. It will be, of course, cross platform. Flocks of developers will seek comfort under its shelter and a kind, enlightened community will arise. It will be awesome.

                Sadly, it is not going to be that easy. The fact that most FPLs have a GC and diminished performance is not mere accident. Functional constructs come at a cost. Closures, for example, make deterministic release of memory extremely difficult.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a reason why I have not given up hope on this idea, though. There are many like minded developers who spend substantial amounts of time working in this direction. Case in point, the good folks at Rust. And as they say, where there is a will, there is way. Compiler technology keeps evolving. Hardware does as well and quantum computing will likely be a game changers.

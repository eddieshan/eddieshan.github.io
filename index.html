            <p>
                Hello, this is Ed. I have been making software non-stop since 1999, while finishing my CS degree.
                I count myself very lucky that I can make a living on something I love doing. I have an innate need of building useful stuff and being a productive person.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than focusing on technology X or Y, I seek to learn things that will make me better at reasoning about<br> 
                problems and solutions. It just so happens that these things are often programming languages that present a new, challenging paradigm  
                that forces me to rewire how I think and approach problems differently.
            </p>
            Here I <a href="writing.html">write</a> about software engineering, architecture, coding and showcase personal <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.</p>

            <p>Please a have a look around, you may find something interesting or even useful.</p>

            <p>
                Hello, this is Ed. I been have making software since 1999, while I was finishing my CS degree at University.
                I count myself very lucky that I can make a living on something I love doing.                
                Here I <a href="writing.html">write</a> about software engineering, architecture, coding and showcase personal <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.</p>
            </p>    
            <p>
                Rather than focusing on technology X or Y, I seek to learn things that will make me better at reasoning about<br> 
                problems and solutions. Or help me think better, in general. 
                Languages, programming or otherwise, are a great way to do this since they rewire your brain,
                provided they present you with a new, challenging paradigm.</p>

                <p>Please a have a look around, you may find something interesting or even useful.</p>

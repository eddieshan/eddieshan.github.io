            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello, this is Ed. Here I <a href="writing.html">write</a> about software engineering, architecture, coding and showcase personal <a href="projects.html">projects</a> as well.</p>

            <p>Software Developer of Engineer would be my trade. Though it comes with a couple of decades of experience, a number of hard/soft skills and a degree, each passing year I am more convinced there is only one genuine, marketable skill that puts bread on my table.</p>
            <p>Namely, the ability to reason about problems and find effective solutions that can be translated to software within given boundaries, such as deadlines and functional or performance requirements.</p>
            <p>If you have time please a have a look around, you may find something interesting or even useful.</p>
